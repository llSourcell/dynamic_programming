    "### \"Dynamic programming amounts to breaking down an optimization problem into simpler sub-problems, and storing the solution to each sub-problem so that each sub-problem is only solved once\" - Bellman \n",

    "- Can be used to solve many problems in time O(n^2) or O(n^3) for which a naive approach would take exponential time\n",
    "- Similar to  “divide-and-conquer” as a general method (mergesort, quicksort), except that unlike divide-and-conquer, the subproblems will typically overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic idea: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Break a problem up into subproblems\n",
    "- Use Optimal Solutions to subproblems to give us optimal solutions to the larger ones\n",
    "- Its OK if our problems overlap, as long as there are not too many of them \n",
    "\n",
    "- Dynamic programming is basically, recursion plus using common sense. What it means is that recursion allows you to express the value of a function in terms of other values of that function. Where the common sense tells you that if you implement your function in a way that the recursive calls are done in advance, and stored for easy access, it will make your program faster. \n",
    "- Trade space for time, i.e. to say that instead of calculating all the states taking a lot of time but no space, we take up space to store the results of all the sub-problems to save time later.\n",

    "Every Dynamic Programming problem has 4 steps:\n",

    "- Show that the problem can be broken down into optimal sub-problems.\n",
    "- Recursively define the value of the solution by expressing it in terms of optimal solutions for smaller sub-problems.\n",
    "- Compute the value of the optimal solution in bottom-up fashion.\n",
    "- Construct an optimal solution from the computed information.\n",
